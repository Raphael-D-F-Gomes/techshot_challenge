# techshot_challenge

This repository has the solved final challenges of a techshot course about logistics in rail network. The objective of the challenges was to create a discrete-time simulation in Python, which describes the behavior of a trains-port-terminal logistics. In short, the train has to load the wagons in the terminal 1 and unload in another terminal. After the loading, the train must go to the nearest port, and then from that port to the port which is nearest too the specified terminal to unload. The output of the simulation is the train schedule. The challenge 1 consider one train and two terminals, the challenge two consider two trains and three terminals. The simulation created is generic, so is easy to change the number of trains, terminals, capacities and other variables in the simulation.
